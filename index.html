    <h1>Cheese is just Amazing</h1>
    
    <p>Cheese is amazing, right? It's a delicious ingredient in a lot of dishes like spaghetti and mac and cheese. It is also something very delicious, a taste you can always
identify that, that is cheese! And there are so many types of cheese to choose from like Mozzarella, Cheddar, and many more just so much more!</p>
    
    <p>But let's think deeper about cheese. I mean cheese is awesome it has been something really important to us humans. But did you know cheese has a fascinating history? It has been enjoyed by humans for over 8000 years. There are even competitions like cheese chasing (check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">cheese chasing video on YouTube</a>) It's very amazing to have a cheese in a world like this. It's fascinating that cheese has been in this world for so long yet it's such a fresh and nice ingredient or topping for pizzas or burgers(Legendary Junk Foods haha). </p>
    
    <p>It's intriguing that something as simple as exposed milk can turn into something as beautiful as cheese. Imagine a world without cheese - what would you put on your spaghetti to make it tastier? Cheese is just as perfect the way it is you know? This cheese thing is not talked about a lot, I wish it was talked about more because cheese is a superhero of spaghettis burgers and more to keep them tasty.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway Thank you for reading this short website:)Here is a brief history of delicious cheese but with faces:</p>
